## Local contacts and how to get help

There is a jumble of organisations each taking responsibility for some parts of Eddington.
This can make it tricky for residents to get the help they need - particularly for those new to the
area, city or country.
While the ERA shouldn't be your first port of call in any case, if you have difficulty
getting a satisfactory response from any of the contacts below please [let us know](/contact-us). Likewise, if
you have a local issue that isn't clearly the responsibility of one of the below, [get in touch](/contact-us).

[Portal Estate Management](https://portal.eddington-cambridge.co.uk/customer-service-team/report-a-defect/){:name='portal'}
deals with issues relating to most shared public spaces in Eddington.
This includes all roads, pavenments, cycle paths and hard and soft landscaping. They are responsible
for collecting the [Estate Management Charge](#estate-management-charge) and spending it on local maintenance, improvement and
contingency planning. They can sometimes
be a useful first contact for services commissioned by other parties below, such as bin collections,
playing fields, play parks and questions around covenants.

[Lodge Property Services](https://eddington-cambridge.co.uk/key-worker-housing-frequently-asked-questions){:name='lodge'}

[Core Sustainable Heat Management](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10586130){:name='core'}
is responsible for heat network infrastructure and the energy centre on Burkitt Lane. Their
responsibility ends before the Heat Interface Unit within each property.

[Hill Residential](){:name='hill'}
are builders of private homes in the areas of Eddington marketed as "Knights' Park" and "Rubicon". They are responsible
for snagging of their newbuild properties and the delivery of shared spaces around those buildings to
Portal. The boundary between shared spaces under Portal's control and those still controlled by Hill
is not well defined as it gradually moves from the latter to the former.

[Girton College](https://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/accommodation/swirles-court){:name='girton-college'}
manages Swirles Court (bounded by Turing Way, Pheasant Drive and the Ridgeway) as
accommodation for mainly postgraduate students remote from the main college site at the north end of Ridgeway.

[South Cambridge District Council](https://www.scambs.gov.uk/your-council-and-democracy/contact-us){:name='south-cambs-council'}

[Broadband Internet](#internet){:name='internet'}

High speed Internet is important for resident's, especially as we carry out more work from home and have to share the same optical fibre or cable with television. We have heard a number issues and questions related to Internet provision at Eddington.

Q: I only have a 12 month fixed tenancy and/or a fixed term contract of employment dependant on research funding. I can only find 18 and 24 month Internet service contracts. Are there alternatives?

A: From 26 May 2011, as result of EU telecoms law changes, the tie-in period for new phone or broadband contracts will be limited to a maximum of 24 months. Consumers [must also be offered a choice](https://web.archive.org/web/20110704193402/http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/2011/05/uk-consumers-benefit-from-european-telecoms-law-changes/) of contract lasting no longer than 12 months, although in practice these deals can be hard to find. We would recommend residents push providers to provide details of 12 month deals where they feel uncomfortable to enter into longer contracts.

Q: I allowed my discounted initial term to automatically renew. Now I find I am tied in to another 18 month term. What can I do?

A: Broadband providers must obtain express consent from the customer before renewing a fixed commitment period. Check to see whether this was given. Express consent is a requirement of [Ofcom's General Conditions](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/112282/guidance-under-general-conditions-c1-contract-requirements.pdf#page=5) to which all UK broadband service providers must comply.
