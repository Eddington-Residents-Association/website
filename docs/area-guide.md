<details><summary>What is a resident's association?</summary>
A resident’s association is a group of people from a neighbourhood that come together to represent their neighbourhood. In our eyes, a resident’s association’s primary role is to build a community, and to connect and support local residents. We do this by organising social events, such as a community restaurant, film club, boardgame club and family outdoor activities. In this way, we hope to make Eddington a warm and welcoming place to live. In addition, we communicate with all parties that are present in Eddington and surroundings, including the Cambridge City Council, Portal, Storey’s Field Centre, Office of Postdoctoral Affairs, New Life Church, Cambridge North West Development group, Girton College and others, to create opportunities for collaboration and support.

<details><summary>I have a concern, but I don’t know who to ask</summary>
If you have a concern and can’t find the right channel, we encourage you to speak with one of us at one of our social events, or ask for a virtual meeting (during the lockdown). ERA members have a good knowledge of how the estate functions, as well as good organisational, financial or communication skills – we are all volunteers who are here to help you and point you to into the right direction when you don’t know where to go.Just as you you might ask your neighbour for informal advice, we are also your neighbours and welcome your questions.You can also ask a question by email but this would put the matter on a more formal basis - we are informed but not experts (at least probably not in the field you are enquiring about), nor able to respond on an insured, professional basis.

<details><summary>Broadband Internet</summary>
High speed Internet is important for resident's, especially as we carry out more work from home and have to share the same optical fibre or cable with television. We have heard a number issues and questions related to Internet provision at Eddington. This page may change as our understanding and the market continues to evolve.

Q: I only have a 12 month fixed tenancy and/or a fixed term contract of employment dependant on research funding. I can only find 18 and 24 month Internet service contracts. Are there alternatives?A: From 26 May 2011, as result of EU telecoms law changes, the tie-in period for new phone or broadband contracts will be limited to a maximum of 24 months. Consumers must also be offered a choice of contract lasting no longer than 12 months, although in practice these deals can be hard to find. We would recommend residents push providers to provide details of 12 month deals where they feel uncomfortable to enter into longer contracts [1].

Q: I allowed my discounted initial term to automatically renew. Now I find I am tied in to another 18 month term. What can I do?A: Broadband providers must obtain express consent from the customer before renewing a fixed commitment period. Check to see whether this was given. Express consent is a requirement of Ofcom's General Conditions to which all UK broadband service providers must comply [2].
