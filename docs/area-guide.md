## Who does what and how to get help

There is a jumble of organisations each taking responsibility for some parts of Eddington. This can make it tricky for residents to get the help they need - particularly for those new to the area, city or country.

While the ERA shouldn't be your first port of call in any case, if you have difficulty getting a satisfactory response from any of the contacts below please [let us know](/contact-us). Likewise, if you have a local issue that isn't clearly the responsibility of one of the below, [get in touch](/contact-us).

<summary>see the list</summary>

[Portal Estate Management](https://portal.eddington-cambridge.co.uk/customer-service-team/report-a-defect/){:name='portal'}
is a wrapper-company owned by the University which deals with issues relating to most shared public spaces in Eddington. This includes all roads, pavenments, cycle paths and hard and soft landscaping.
They are responsible for collecting the [Estate Service Charge](#estate-management-charge) and spending it on local maintenance, improvement and contingency planning. Though they subcontract the billing to [Vital](#vital) and the execution of estate management tasks to [Mears](#mears).
Portal can sometimes be a useful first contact for services commissioned by other parties below, such as bin collections, playing fields, play parks and questions around covenants.

[Lodge Property Services](https://eddington-cambridge.co.uk/key-worker-housing-frequently-asked-questions){:name='lodge'}
is a wrapper-company owned by the University which manages tenancy in the University's so-called "Key Worker Housing". This includes all properties in Eddington which are owned by the University and let out exclusively to their employees through their [Accommodation Service](https://www.accommodation.cam.ac.uk/). They effectively fill the role of an in-house estate agent, but maintenance of the property, its contents and shared internal spaces falls to [Portal](#portal).

[Core Sustainable Heat Management](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10586130){:name='core'}
is a wrapper-company owned by the University responsible for heat network infrastructure in Eddington and the energy centre on Burkitt Lane. Their responsibility ends before the Heat Interface Unit within each property. Consumer billing and much of the network's maintenance is subcontracted to [Vital Energi](#vital).

[Vital Energi](https://www.vitalenergi.co.uk/){:name='vital'}
provide customer billing services to Portal and Core, for Estate Service Charge and heat usage respectively. They also run our energy centre and maintain our local heat network infrastructure as the current contract holder under Core.

[Mears](https://www.mearsgroup.co.uk/){:name='mears'}
are a national housing services operator. They provide estate management services around Eddington as the current contract holder under Portal. They also do property management for Lodge, and both of these work packages form part of a broader contract with the University outside of Eddington.

[Hill Residential](https://www.hill.co.uk/){:name='hill'}
are builders of private homes in the areas of Eddington marketed as "Knights' Park" and "Rubicon". They are responsible for snagging of their newbuild properties and the delivery of shared spaces around those buildings to Portal. The boundary between shared spaces under Portal's control and those still controlled by Hill is not well defined as it gradually moves from the latter to the former.

[Girton College](https://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/accommodation/swirles-court){:name='girton-college'}
manages Swirles Court (bounded by Turing Way, Pheasant Drive and the Ridgeway) as accommodation for mainly postgraduate students remote from the main college site at the north end of Ridgeway.

[Councils](#councils){:name='councils'}
are a uniquely complicated aspect of Eddington, sitting as we do across the city boundary and a parish boundary. Due to the private nature of the shared spaces and the non-adopted status of roads in Eddington they have fewer responsibilities here than elsewhere in the UK.

[South Cambridge District Council](https://www.scambs.gov.uk/your-council-and-democracy/contact-us){:name='district-council'}

[Cambridge City Council](https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/){:name='city-council'}

[Girton Parish Council](https://www.girton-cambs.org.uk/girton-parish-council-2/){:name='parish-council'}

[Cambridgeshire County Council](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/){:name='county-council'}

## Transport, roads and parking

[Local Bus Services](#buses){:name='buses'}
in Eddington are provided by Whippet's [Universal bus routes](https://www.whippetbus.co.uk/universal/) U1 and U2. These are subsidised by the University for all users regardless of affiliation. Residents frequently report delayed and cancelled buses at both peak and non-peak times. Reportedly the [offical Whippet app](https://www.whippetbus.co.uk/app/) provides more accurate live bus timing information than is displayed on the bus stop screens.

More direct bus routes to the town centre are available at the [Madingley Park & Ride](https://cambridgeparkandride.info/madingleyroad-times.shtml) to the south and on [Huntingdon Road](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/52.2355988,0.0882609/Thornton+Road,+Girton,+Cambridge+CB3+0LG) to the north.


[Car Parking](#parking){:name='parking'}
is available on-street throughout Eddington and normally requires registration during daytime hours. Anyone can register to park using the [JustPark app](https://www.justpark.com/) or one of the central parking machines. Once you register your visit, the first hour is free and then it's roughly £2 per hour thereafter. Maximum parking time limits apply via this method, normally of two or four hours. Full information on the [Cashless on-site parking info sheet](https://portal.eddington-cambridge.co.uk/_downloads/Eddington-Parking-Information_202309.pdf) - our location code is 2604.

Residents and their visitors parking in these public spaces can use a separate system to register for a 24 period, and for a reduced fee (flat £2.80 at the time of writing). [Connect Cashless Parking](https://www.connectcashlessparking.com/) is the provider and they offer
both phone and app-based payment. A limit of 100 days per year is applied per household to prevent a small number of residents from monopolising the limited spaces.

90 minutes of free parking without registration is available for users of Sainsbury's and Argos in their underground car park. 18 hours of free parking without registration is available at Madingley Park & Ride.

[Broadband Internet](#internet){:name='internet'}

High speed Internet is important for resident's, especially as we carry out more work from home and have to share the same optical fibre or cable with television. We have heard a number issues and questions related to Internet provision at Eddington.

Q: I only have a 12 month fixed tenancy and/or a fixed term contract of employment dependant on research funding. I can only find 18 and 24 month Internet service contracts. Are there alternatives?

A: From 26 May 2011, as result of EU telecoms law changes, the tie-in period for new phone or broadband contracts will be limited to a maximum of 24 months. Consumers [must also be offered a choice](https://web.archive.org/web/20110704193402/http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/2011/05/uk-consumers-benefit-from-european-telecoms-law-changes/) of contract lasting no longer than 12 months, although in practice these deals can be hard to find. We would recommend residents push providers to provide details of 12 month deals where they feel uncomfortable to enter into longer contracts.

Q: I allowed my discounted initial term to automatically renew. Now I find I am tied in to another 18 month term. What can I do?

A: Broadband providers must obtain express consent from the customer before renewing a fixed commitment period. Check to see whether this was given. Express consent is a requirement of [Ofcom's General Conditions](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/112282/guidance-under-general-conditions-c1-contract-requirements.pdf#page=5) to which all UK broadband service providers must comply.
