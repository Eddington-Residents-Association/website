The ERA exists to help build a vibrant community, bringing together the wide variety of residents
from all over the world. If you are planning an event or a regular session we may be able to help
you to:

* Book venues
* Find sponsorship or grants
* Sort out insurance and risk assessment
* Recruit volunteers
* Promote the event by email, online and in print

We might not be able to help with all of the above for a proposed event. Events are more likely to
be good candidates for ERA support and promotion the more they fulfill the following criteria:

* The event is organised by an Eddington resident and open to all residents
* The event is solely or primarily for the benefit of Eddington residents
* The event takes place within a short walk of Storeyâ€™s Field Centre
* The event is free or cheap compared to similar alternatives
* The event is novel, i.e. not a regularly scheduled event
* Examples of events which the ERA have supported include: The Jubilee Picnic; Eddington Eats; Film Club; Quiz Night; Diwali Celebrations
