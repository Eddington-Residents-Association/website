The ERA exists to help build a vibrant community, bringing together the wide variety of residents
from all over the world. If you are planning an event or a regular session we may be able to help
you to:

* Book venues
* Find sponsorship or grants
* Sort out insurance and risk assessment
* Recruit volunteers
* Promote the event by email, online and in print

<a name="support_criteria"></a>

We might not be able to help with all of the above for a proposed event. Events are more likely to
be good candidates for ERA support and promotion the more they fulfil the following criteria:

* Open to all residents
* Solely or primarily for the benefit of Eddington residents
* Takes place within a short walk of Eddington Square
* Free or cheap compared to similar alternatives
* Organised by an Eddington resident
* Novel

Examples of events which the ERA have supported include: The Jubilee Picnic, Eddington Eats,
Film Club, Quiz Night, Diwali Celebrations.

If you already run an event we can help you promote it on this site,
via our [newsletter](https://us5.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=77028e27d8594eefd09bbb473&id=4e3157944d)
