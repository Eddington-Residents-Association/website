title: Incorrect Parking Sign at Sports Pavilion

11th June 2025

We have confirmed with Portal that the new yellow and blue sign which adds car parking requirements for the spaces at the Sports Pavilion was put up in error and will be removed. This was done as part of a refresh of parking signage around the estate but does not align with Portal's intent to keep that car park free for users of the sports pitches, as well as for school pick-up and drop-off.

We understand that:

- the sign was put up in error
- it will be removed this week (~11th June 2025)
- Elite (the company which does parking enforcement) does not patrol this area
- Portal will cancel any parking tickets raised at this location on request

Residents and visitors are encouraged to continue using the space for short-term parking. For any questions or concerns, or to report being ticketed in this area, contact Portal [portal@eddington-cambridge.co.uk](mailto:portal@eddington-cambridge.co.uk).

There are reports of abuse of this facility with cars and vans being left there for a day or longer. Portal is looking to assess the impact of this behaviour and may consider putting in place limited parking restrictions to ensure spaces are available for the intended, short-term uses.
