immediately following Portal's Residents Forum

Each year we meet to take stock of the previous twelve months and set a course for the year to come. All residents are encouraged to attend, to ask questions about what we do and to find out how to get involved.

The ERA only exists because a group of residents decided to set it up. It only continues because a handful of local volunteers want to do something for the community. And it will only endure if Eddington residents give their time to keep the gears turning.

## Why are we doing this?

An active and representative residents association can help the University deliver on the promise of Eddington without compromising the peace and enjoyment of current residents. We live in a new, wonderful and peculiar place - and one that still has much growing to do. Keeping residents informed about its present and involved in its future is a worthy cause.

## What you can do

- **Come to the AGM** - it shouldn't take an hour
- **Bring a neighbour** - not everyone feels confident or welcome to local events. This one really is for everyone who lives here.
- **Stand for a position** - there's a (brief!) election process at the AGM. If you'd like to hold a named position then we would be very happy to [hear from you](/contact-us) in advance.
- **Ask questions** - in advance, in person or [in writing](/contact-us). As yet another [opaque, local organisation](/handbook#portal) in Eddington we are happy to be quizzed on what we do and why we do it.
- **Join our [newsletter](/newsletter)** to hear feedback after the meeting, included in the monthly what's on guide.

## If you can't attend

- **Let us know** - not everyone is available on a given day and we only do this once each year. [Send us and email](/contact) if you're going to miss out and we'll keep you in the loop.
- **Join our [newsletter](/newsletter)** as we'll wrap up the AGM stuff in May's edition.
