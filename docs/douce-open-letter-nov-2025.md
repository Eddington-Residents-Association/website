## Context

In October 2025 [residents became aware](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQB4x-NjBkM) of the hotel's plan to terminate at short notice the lease held by Douce Heights on the rooftop bar area. We understand that this is as a consequence of a group-level decision by the company which owns the hotel - a decision over which the University of Cambridge has no influence. The team at Douce have made significant investments in building a social life in Eddington for over five years from their start in an Airstream caravan in Eddington Square.

_Edit on 21<sup>st</sup> Nov - a minority of early signatories appear to mistakenly think that Douce's hair salon and cafe at street level is being threatened with closure. This is not the case, though it is negatively impacted by the closure of the rooftop due to loss of shared resources._

_Edit on 5<sup>th</sup> Dec - This letter has been sent to the University and to Douce. Their responses will be published here in due course._

_Edit on 28<sup>th</sup> Jan - Responses have been received from both [Douce](#:~:text=Comment from Douce) and the [University](#:~:text=Response from the University of Cambridge)_

## The Open Letter
---

We the undersigned, resident in Eddington, believe that the University of Cambridge owes a debt of gratitude to the individuals behind Douce Ltd. Their enterprising spirit has provided sustained cover, particularly during a time when the retail units in Eddington Square were largely vacant. Without the resourcefulness of the Douce team, the provision of amenities and third spaces in Eddington would have been quite poor for many months and the nascent community would have suffered for it.

We furthermore find the minimal-notice eviction of Douce Heights Ltd. by The Edyn Group (owners of the local Turing Locke/Hyatt Centric hotel block) to be directly damaging to the local ecosystem. Given the Douce team’s investment and effort in bringing an unused space into regular public use - and whatever the space’s contractual status - it is unfair that a local enterprise be unceremoniously dumped by the changing of an international corporate’s agenda.

We ask that the University does everything in its power to mitigate the wasted potential here. That it prioritises providing an opportunity for this team to continue its enterprising service to the local community. That it recognises the long-term ability of ambitious hairdressers in a caravan to inject some life and culture into a place chronically lacking in facilities to incubate it.

<div>
I fully support this petition - the Douce team have brought so much heart and soul to the community, the idea that they’re being pushed out by a corporate group who don’t even reside in Cambridge is ridiculous. I thought part of the Eddington ethos was to support local business and help us build a community, not give a company external to Cambridge the power to remove a vital heart of Eddington.
</div>
<div>
I am totally shock and upset to hear that Douce heights has been given short notice of terminating there lease of the rooftop bar after investing on knowing they signed a long term lease. I find this very upsetting for all those involved and the community of Eddington of a loss of a great community hub and fantastic venue.
</div>
<div>
We enjoyed our weekly visits with our pup.
</div>
<div>
Disappointed to see this happen not only to Douce Heights but to Dutch and The Astronomer. Eddington will not be the same without these businesses who have worked really hard to offer great service to the communities in Eddington and locally in northwest Cambridge
</div>
<div>
We need to empower small businesses not shut them down. This world belongs to everyone who live in it and we all need to be comfortable not only the rich.
</div>
<div>
Hugely disappointed with what Hyatt have done to Douch Heights. They did the same with Brew, will shortly be doing the same with The Astronomer - and I worry for the future of Dutch too.
</div>
<div>
This is a space that brings our community together and brings joy to our lives outside of work.
Douche have been far and away the most innovative and community minded enterprise in Eddington. They deserve far better treatment.
</div>
<div>
Independent businesses play an important role in a community because they keep money circulating locally and help create real connections between people. They also respond faster to what a community actually needs often more personal service and bring a character into the area which Douce obviously have from the very beginning particularly when Eddington was like a graveyard.
</div>
<div>
Local businesses (most notably Douce) [...] have consistently volunteered their time, energy, and creativity to organise events and initiatives that enrich the area, despite having no obligation to do so. Their continued presence in Eddington is vital to the well-being and cohesion of the community. And if relocation is deemed necessary, it should be recognised that Eddington owes these businesses its full support in securing a future that allows them to keep contributing to the life and spirit of the neighbourhood.
</div>
<div>
As a frequent visitor to Douce Heights I was impressed with what the team had done - and so very disappointed to hear how ruthlessly they have been kicked out of this space.
</div>
<div>
The incredible atmosphere and food at Douce heights has always been a credit to Eddington and has aided the creation of many great memories for me personally. I would be upset to see a business so full of heart be stamped out so early when it should be celebrated and enjoyed for years to come.
</div>
<div>
I am very disappointed that this has happened to Douce.  Small business that has achieve great things in the community.  I feel very sorry for the people who have invested there money to make this project work.
</div>
<div>
To build a community in Eddington we need community spaces
</div>
<div>
What [corr: Edyn Group] have done is atrocious, please ensure that the owners of Douce are given back their rooftop spot
</div>
<div>
Douce is beloved by the local residents of Eddington. Used as a meeting place with friendly staff fas it is dog friendly. It also serves the community with it's convenience of well done hair care services who are also family friendly for children.
</div>
<div>
Please give a chance to local business. Community before profit.
Community matters
</div>
<div>
Without the rooftop Eddington resident's will be missing out on a great social place to bring family and friends
</div>
<div>
Douce has made an enormous contribution to the local community. They make living in Eddington so much nicer and especially after having had my baby, knowing I could go down there and just sit and have a hot drink and get out of the house in a beautiful pleasant space made such a big difference.
Douce provides a vibrant feel to Eddington Square - it would be a great shame to lose it especially as they have worked so hard to create a community resource.
</div>
<div>
We support local entrepreneurs who have risk a lot to bring some life to this empty neighbourhood. Douce were the first ones offering their services initially from their van. This treatment is unfair and we want them back.
</div>
<div>
The ability of retaining young researchers to the University falls under a wide range of factors but an often underestimated factor is the sense of belonging to a thriving community outside of the academic one. Douce is a space that has helped support the Eddington community for young researchers, families and other small enterprises. Losing this space will be a loss to the university indirectly.
</div>
<div>
Douce Heights has not only provided an amazing venue for residents to go to but has earned itself and Eddington an exceptional social space to visit within Cambridge encouraging other businesses to flourish as more people visit the area
</div>
<div>
In addition to the excellent pizzas, Douce Heights has been a community meeting place with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. We would always see our neighbours there!
</div>
<div>
Douce are integral to the success of Eddiington.
</div>
<div>
Independent businesses thrive and ate valued here. Let’s encourage and applaud our entrepreneurs rather than lining pockets of corporate businesses.
We need to support local business and trailblazers and risk takers.
</div>
<div>
Douce has been a space that’s been bringing life and building community in Eddington since they started, and it’s awful to see them being treated as something disposable when they’ve been pouring so much positivity energy into the community.
</div>
<div>
In a new community at the risk of feeling commercial and full the heights is the stand out spark. [...] I urge the university as custodians of the Eddington community to take action and protect what is a shining light in the community. My wish would be for this to go one step further and make further provisions for this enterprise to be able to thrive and plan with security.
</div>
<div>
Douce Heights is a brilliant asset to Eddington and contributed massively to the feel of the area. Many of my best memories in Eddington have been from events on the roof and it's a real shame that the Hotel group want to take that away.
</div>
<div>
The cynical removal of Douce’s right to operate the rooftop bar is a slap in the face for their entrepreneurial spirit and the sheer hard work involved in making a success of the venue (which the hotel had singularly failed to do). Douce’s loyal customer base will certainly not welcome this change.
</div>
<div>
Douce has made a huge contribution to Eddington. Douce Heights had a unique character and was much-loved by Eddington residents and others from the surrounding area. Its closure was a huge loss to the Eddington community.
</div>
<div>
We, people living in Eddington, are very sad about loosing the roof bar and the restaurant, please don't let the same to happen to Douce or anything else!
</div>
<div>
Douce have been supporting the community through their socially orientated enterprises. Whatever the contractual position they have been treated shabbily by The Edyn Group. I urge the University to do whatever they can to rectify this injustice.
</div>
<div>
I find the behaviour by Hyatt egregious and unbecoming. Douche and other local enterprises have made great efforts to instal community spirit and a vibrant atmosphere to the area. Hyatt should be ashamed  
</div>
<div>
Douce makes Eddington a special, trendy place. Always creating a wonderful environment and great events to the community.
</div>
<div>
We love visiting the open bar which has ample space for children to run around and the food is great.
</div>

## Response from the University of Cambridge - 14th January 2026

Thank you for sharing the open letter.

The University recognises the important contribution that Douce Heights had during its tenure and their popularity with the local community. We have been equally disappointed that they and others were asked to vacate. While we understand the strength of feeling reflected in the petition, the decision about Douce Heights was with the hotel operator and the University cannot change this.

We are currently in active discussions with prospective occupiers and remain committed to supporting local businesses as part of our retail strategy. These conversations are ongoing, and while we cannot comment on specific lease negotiations, we are working collaboratively to explore solutions that meet both community aspirations and deliver a vibrant neighbourhood, balancing viability and the strategic objectives of Eddington.

We appreciate the constructive spirit in which this petition has been raised. As always, we will keep the Eddington community updated with the latest developments when details are confirmed.


## Comment from Douce Ltd. - 25 January 2026

The past twelve months have been incredibly difficult for our business, but the community’s  overwhelming support has made them much easier.

We will take the last eighteen months of running douce heights as a tremendous learning curve and something we can springboard off into our next venture.

A special thanks to the university. While this has been beyond their control, they have provided support in many ways during the terrible situation our landlords have put us through.

Whilst we pursue the opportunity of a new venture for the community, we’d like to thank everyone for their patience whilst we aim to deliver something that is unique and beneficial to Eddington, neighbouring villages and beyond.

We hope to see you at douce for events, coffee, pints soon whilst we work hard on the next chapter.

With love, from all at douce
