Dust off your old instrument. Play with your child or grandchild. Find new musical friends or make beautiful music together. Come join us if you play an orchestral instrument at grade 2 or above (entry is free).

Formed in the autumn of 2024 with 20 musicians aged 8 to 74, we practice most Sundays from 3 to 4.30 pm at Storey’s Field Centre under the direction of Laurie Friday. This term, we are preparing for a spring concert: Carnival of the Animals (but not what Saint-Saëns had in mind!).
