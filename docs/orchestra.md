Conceived by a nine-year-old Eddington resident and formed in the autumn of 2024 with 20 musicians aged 8 to 74, if you play an orchestral instrument and would like to make beautiful music and make musical friends, please joins us.  

You will need to be grade 2 or above.  We practice most Sundays during term time from 3-4.30 pm at Storey’s Field Centre, under the direction of Laurie Friday.  We think we are a very relaxed and flexible group, so check with us if you have any special needs or questions.

This term we are working towards a selection of pieces from the Nutcracker with a concert scheduled for December 13, 2025 at the Storey’s Field Centre in Eddington.

Come join us! Email  [eddingtonorchestra@gmail.com](mailto:eddingtonorchestra@gmail.com) or register your interest [here](https://forms.gle/7ehZfGo7EEJRr5vQA).

Membership and the concerts that we put up at Storey’s field Centre in Eddington are all free. We practice most term-time Sundays from 3-4.30 pm (free parking available at the local park and ride). We operate under the aegis of the Eddington Residents Association.

**Past concerts:**

**About our music director**

Our Music Director is Laurie Friday. She is an enthusiastic horn player (and occasional bassist) in orchestras around Cambridge and has more than 50 years’ experience of observing conductors – including Norman del Mar, Christopher Seaman, Daniel Harding, Martyn Brabbins, Nicholas Cleobury, Timothy Redmond, Stephen Bingham, among many others - from a player’s perspective. Since retiring from a career of University research, teaching and admin, she has been exploring the craft of the conductor as a member of the Girton Conducting Course under the tutelage of Denise Ham and Leif Tse. Laurie is thrilled to be developing her conducting, arranging - and story-telling - skills with the ECO, devising fun, musically-satisfying concerts to be performed by our multigenerational orchestra for audiences of children and adults.
