## Who does what and how to get help

There is a jumble of organisations each taking responsibility for some parts of Eddington. This can make it tricky for residents to get the help they need - particularly for those new to the area, city or country.

While the ERA is unlikely to be the best first port of call, if you have difficulty getting a satisfactory response from any of the contacts below please [let us know](/contact-us). Likewise, if you have a local issue that isn't clearly the responsibility of one of the below, [get in touch](/contact-us).

<details markdown="1">
<summary>See details of our many providers and for what each is responsible</summary>

[Portal Estate Management](https://portal.eddington-cambridge.co.uk/customer-service-team/report-a-defect/){:name='portal'}
is a wrapper-company owned by the University which deals with issues relating to most shared public spaces in Eddington. This includes all roads, pavements, cycle paths and hard and soft landscaping.
They are responsible for collecting the [Estate Service Charge](#estate-management-charge) and spending it on local maintenance, improvement and contingency planning. Though they subcontract the billing to [Vital](#vital) and the execution of estate management tasks to [Mears](#mears).
Portal can sometimes be a useful first contact for services commissioned by other parties below, such as bin collections, playing fields, play parks and questions around covenants.

[Lodge Property Services](https://eddington-cambridge.co.uk/key-worker-housing-frequently-asked-questions){:name='lodge'}
is a wrapper-company owned by the University which manages tenancy in the University's so-called "Key Worker Housing". This includes all properties in Eddington which are owned by the University and let out exclusively to their employees through their [Accommodation Service](https://www.accommodation.cam.ac.uk/). They effectively fill the role of an in-house estate agent, but maintenance of the property, its contents and shared internal spaces falls to [Portal](#portal).

[Core Sustainable Heat Management](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10586130){:name='core'}
is a wrapper-company owned by the University responsible for heat network infrastructure in Eddington and the energy centre on Burkitt Lane. Their responsibility ends before the Heat Interface Unit within each property. Consumer billing and much of the network's maintenance is subcontracted to [Vital Energi](#vital).

[Vital Energi](https://www.vitalenergi.co.uk/){:name='vital'}
provide customer billing services to Portal and Core, for Estate Service Charge and heat usage respectively. They also run our energy centre and maintain our local heat network infrastructure as the current contract holder under Core.

[Mears](https://www.mearsgroup.co.uk/){:name='mears'}
are a national housing services operator. They provide estate management services around Eddington as the current contract holder under Portal. They also do property management for Lodge, and both of these work packages form part of a broader contract with the University outside of Eddington.

[Hill Residential](https://www.hill.co.uk/){:name='hill'}
are builders of private homes in the areas of Eddington marketed as "Knights' Park" and "Rubicon". They are responsible for snagging of their newbuild properties and the delivery of shared spaces around those buildings to Portal. The boundary between shared spaces under Portal's control and those still controlled by Hill is not well defined as it gradually moves from the latter to the former.

[Girton College](https://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/accommodation/swirles-court){:name='girton-college'}
manages Swirles Court (bounded by Turing Way, Pheasant Drive and the Ridgeway) as accommodation for mainly postgraduate students remote from the main college site at the north end of Ridgeway.

[Councils](#councils){:name='councils'}
are a uniquely complicated aspect of Eddington, sitting as we do across the city boundary and a parish boundary. Due to the private nature of the shared spaces and the non-adopted status of roads in Eddington they have fewer responsibilities here than elsewhere in the UK.

[South Cambridge District Council](https://www.scambs.gov.uk/your-council-and-democracy/contact-us){:name='district-council'}

[Cambridge City Council](https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/){:name='city-council'}

[Girton Parish Council](https://www.girton-cambs.org.uk/girton-parish-council-2/){:name='parish-council'}

## Transport, roads and parking

[Local Bus Services](#buses){:name='buses'}
in Eddington are provided by Whippet's [Universal bus routes](https://www.whippetbus.co.uk/universal/) U1 and U2. These are subsidised by the University for all users regardless of affiliation. Residents frequently report delayed and cancelled buses at both peak and non-peak times. Reportedly the [official Whippet app](https://www.whippetbus.co.uk/app/) provides more accurate live bus timing information than is displayed on the bus stop screens. More direct bus routes to the town centre are available at the [Madingley Park & Ride](https://cambridgeparkandride.info/madingleyroad-times.shtml) to the south and on [Huntingdon Road](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/52.2355988,0.0882609/Thornton+Road,+Girton,+Cambridge+CB3+0LG) to the north.

[Car Parking](#parking){:name='parking'}
is available on-street throughout Eddington and normally requires registration during daytime hours. The spaces are for public use but residents and their visitors can access a lower rate and longer stays. Free parking is available in a few places, each with some restriction (see details)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>See options for how and where to park</summary>

Anyone can register their car using the [JustPark app](https://www.justpark.com/) or one of the central parking machines. Once you register your visit, the first hour is free and then it's roughly £2 per hour thereafter. Maximum parking time limits apply via this method, normally of two or four hours. Full information on the [Cashless on-site parking info sheet](https://portal.eddington-cambridge.co.uk/_downloads/Eddington-Parking-Information_202309.pdf).

Residents and their visitors parking in these public spaces can use a separate system to register for a 24 period, and for a reduced fee (flat £2.80 at the time of writing). [Connect Cashless Parking](https://www.connectcashlessparking.com/) is the provider and they offer
both phone and app-based payment, location code 2604. A limit of 100 days per year is applied per household to prevent a small number of residents from monopolising the limited spaces.

90 minutes of free parking without registration is available for users of Sainsbury's and Argos in their underground car park. 18 hours of free parking without registration is available at Madingley Park & Ride.

[A Local Travel Survey](/reports/2023 stakeholders travel survey update.pdf){:name=travel-survey}{:target="_blank"}
is carried out by the University every year. It surveys residents, workers, shoppers and families with kids at the local school about their use of different modes of transport. This helps to account for the growing and changing transport profile of the area.

## Water, waste, heating, internet, mobile etc.

[A Heat Network](#heat-network){:name='heat-network'}
provides hot water to most properties in Eddington for both space heating and water heating. The distributing network itself is a closed system of pipes connecting an HIU in each building to the Energy Centre on Burkitt Lane. It is managed by [Core](#core) with maintenance and billing provided by [Vital Energi](#vital).
The system is powered by commercial gas boilers after the original plan to run a [combined heat and power](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/combined-heat-and-power) plant proved infeasible. A more sustainable approach is desired by the University but has not yet been identified.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>See details of network design, resident responsibilities and heat pricing</summary>

The distribution network is a series of insulated, underground pipes which carry water at around 90°C. The circuit is closed: heat exchangers in each property's HIU raise the temperature of either their incoming fresh water or separately sealed underfloor circuits as needed. All water pumped out of the Energy Centre ultimately returns there - it does not come out of residents' taps nor does it flow through their underfloor heating circuits.

Core's equipment stops at the heat network pipes that enter each building. Homeowners are responsible for their HIU, which they own. The standing charge includes a two-yearly service from Core (for which access must be allowed). Underfloor heating and other domestic plumbing is also beyond the scope of Core's responsibilities.

Usage is charged for based on the difference in temperature between incoming and outgoing network water. As of early 2024, heat network billing is not covered by energy price caps though this effect is offset by the commercial gas purchasing policy of the University, which acts to hold input costs relatively stable.

[Internet Connectivity](#internet){:name='internet'}
is available [many providers](https://www.openreach.com/fibre-broadband/fttp-providers) on the OpenReach fibre network. Many properties also have fibre connections to [Virgin Media](https://www.virginmedia.com/broadband). [Eduroam](https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/service/wifi/connect-to-eduroam) is available in some central areas but not within every building.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>See advice for short-term contracts and renewal</summary>

Residents on 12-month tenancies have reported difficulty finding ISPs offering contracts of less than 18 months. EU law requires [consumers be offered the option](https://web.archive.org/web/20110704193402/http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/2011/05/uk-consumers-benefit-from-european-telecoms-law-changes/) of contract lasting no longer than 12 months, although some providers make these hard to find. Renewal of internet contracts is governed by [Ofcom's General Conditions](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/112282/guidance-under-general-conditions-c1-contract-requirements.pdf#page=5) which means ISPs have to get the customer's consent before renewing a fixed commitment period.

## Health, fitness and wellbeing

[Our Local Doctor's Surgery](#doctor){:name='doctor'}
is [Huntingdon Road Surgery](https://huntingdonroadsurgery.co.uk/) until such time as the [health centre](#health-centre) is occupied. It also has a [satellite surgery](https://www.nhs.uk/services/gp-surgery/girton-branch-surgery/D81002001) in Girton.

[No Pharmacy](#pharmacy){:name='pharmacy'}
exists in Eddington, nor can residents use the [dispensary in Girton](https://www.huntingdonroadsurgery.co.uk/girton-dispensary) run by Huntingdon Road Surgery. The nearest pharmacy is on [Histon Road](https://rowlandspharmacy.co.uk/). Plans for a local pharmacy seem contingent on there being a doctor's surgery here first, at which point Sainsbury's have indicated they may add one in-store.

[The Health Centre](#heath-centre){:name='health-centre'}
is at at the south end of Eddington Avenue ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/@52.2170912,0.0882417,3a,42.9y,275.96h,96.26t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s3aYXVcbz4yZbBBHY_OlrTQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu)), near Sainsbury's car park entrance. The unit is empty and its interior unfinished. Negotiations with the NHS to find an occupant have been very slow. In early 2024 Portal said a proposal was being considered for a multi-use health facility - which means not exclusively a doctor's office but with GP provision among other health services. The proposal targeted an opening in mid 2025, we are told.
