A guide for residents of Eddington to the many places, processes, practices and policies that are uniquely relevant to this development. This remains a work-in-progress - please [contribute any corrections]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/main/docs/{{ page.path }}){:target="_blank"}.

## Who does what and how to get help

There is a jumble of organisations each taking responsibility for some parts of Eddington. This can make it tricky for residents to get the help they need - particularly for those new to the area, city or country.

While the ERA is unlikely to be the best first port of call, if you have difficulty getting a satisfactory response from any of the contacts below please [let us know](/contact-us). Likewise, if you have a local issue that isn't clearly the responsibility of one of the below, [get in touch](/contact-us).

<details markdown="1">
<summary>See details of our many providers and for what each is responsible</summary>

[Portal Estate Management](https://portal.eddington-cambridge.co.uk/customer-service-team/report-a-defect/){:name='portal'}
is a wrapper-company owned by the University which deals with issues relating to most shared public spaces in Eddington. This includes all roads, pavements, cycle paths and hard and soft landscaping.
They are responsible for collecting the [Estate Service Charge](#estate-management-charge) and spending it on local maintenance, improvement and contingency planning. Though they subcontract the billing to [Vital](#vital) and the execution of estate management tasks to [Mears](#mears).
Portal can sometimes be a useful first contact for services commissioned by other parties below, such as bin collections, playing fields, play parks and questions around covenants.

[Lodge Property Services](#lodge){:name='lodge'}
is a wrapper-company owned by the University which manages tenancy in the University's so-called "[Key Worker Housing](https://eddington-cambridge.co.uk/key-worker-housing-frequently-asked-questions)". This includes all properties in Eddington which are owned by the University and let out exclusively to their employees through their [Accommodation Service](https://www.accommodation.cam.ac.uk/). They effectively fill the role of an in-house estate agent, but maintenance of the property, its contents and shared internal spaces is done by [Portal](#portal).

[Core Sustainable Heat Management](#core){:name='core'}
is a [wrapper-company](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10586130) owned by the University responsible for heat network infrastructure in Eddington and the energy centre on Burkitt Lane. Their responsibility ends before the Heat Interface Unit within each property. Consumer billing and much of the network's maintenance is subcontracted to [Vital Energi](#vital).

[Vital Energi](#vital){:name='vital'}
are an [energy management company](https://www.vitalenergi.co.uk/) that run our energy centre and maintain our local heat network infrastructure as the current contract holder under Core. They also provide customer billing services to Portal and Core, for Estate Service Charge and heat usage respectively.

[Mears Group](#mears){:name='mears'}
are a national [housing services operator](https://www.mearsgroup.co.uk/). They provide estate management services around Eddington as the current contract holder under Portal. They also do property management for Lodge, and both of these work packages form part of a broader contract with the University outside of Eddington.

[Nurture Landscapes](#nurture){:name='nurture'}
are a [grounds maintenance company](https://www.nurture-group.co.uk/) subcontracted by [Mears](#mears) to look after communal planting and hard landscaping.

[Elite Parking Management](#elite){:name='elite'}
are a [parking management company](https://eliteparkingmanagement.com/) subcontracted by [Mears](#mears) to handle parking enforcement and fines.

[Encore Estates](#encore){:name='encore'}
provide [property management services](https://www.encoreestates.co.uk/) for several of the privately-owned apartment blocks. They maintain communal, non-public areas such as entrances, stairs, elevators and garages as well as any garden areas belonging to the building. Leaseholders pay a building management fee for these services in addition to the [estate service charge](#estate-service-charge).

[Hill Residential](#hill){:name='hill'}
are builders of private homes in the areas of Eddington marketed as "[Knights' Park](https://www.hill.co.uk/all-developments/cambridgeshire/knights-park)" and "[Rubicon](https://www.knightspark-eddington.co.uk/phases/rubicon/)". They are responsible for snagging of their newbuild properties and the delivery of shared spaces around those buildings to Portal. The boundary between shared spaces under Portal's control and those still controlled by Hill is not well defined as it gradually moves from the latter to the former.

[Present Made](#present-made){:name='present-made'}
build and operate market rental properties. These are early examples of the [UK's build-to-rent initiative](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/build-to-rent) and as such cannot be sold and are expected to remain managed by the developer for the long term. Present Made are responsible for the maintenance of their properties, communal facilities and some of the immediate landscaping. As part of their rent tenants pay into the [estate service charge](#estate-service-charge) for maintenance of shared areas across Eddington, which are maintained by Portal.

[Girton College](#girton-college){:name='girton-college'}
manages [Swirles Court](https://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/accommodation/swirles-court) (bounded by Turing Way, Pheasant Drive and the Ridgeway) as accommodation for mainly postgraduate students remote from the main college site at the north end of Ridgeway.

[The University of Cambridge](#university){:name='university'}
created Eddington to support their growth plan and migration from the city centre. Their [Estates division](https://www.em.admin.cam.ac.uk/) is responsible for continued planning and delivery of the development.

[Councils](#councils){:name='councils'}
are a uniquely complicated aspect of Eddington, sitting as we do across the city boundary and a parish boundary. Due to the private nature of the shared spaces and the non-adopted status of roads in Eddington they have fewer responsibilities here than elsewhere in the UK.

## Transport, roads and parking

[Local Bus Services](#buses){:name='buses'}
in Eddington are provided by Whippet's [Universal bus routes](https://www.whippetbus.co.uk/universal/) U1 and U2. These are subsidised by the University for all users regardless of affiliation. Residents frequently report delayed and cancelled buses at both peak and non-peak times. Reportedly the [official Whippet app](https://www.whippetbus.co.uk/app/) provides more accurate live bus timing information than is displayed on the bus stop screens. More direct bus routes to the town centre are available at the [Madingley Park & Ride](https://cambridgeparkandride.info/madingleyroad-times.shtml) to the south and on [Huntingdon Road](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/52.2355988,0.0882609/Thornton+Road,+Girton,+Cambridge+CB3+0LG) to the north.

[Car Parking](#parking){:name='parking'}
is available on-street throughout Eddington and normally requires registration during daytime hours. The spaces are for public use but residents and their visitors can access a lower rate and longer stays. Free parking is available in a few places, each with some restriction (see details)

<details markdown="1">
<summary>See options for how and where to park</summary>

Anyone can register their car using the [JustPark app](https://www.justpark.com/) or one of the central parking machines. Once you register your visit, the first hour is free and then it's roughly £2 per hour thereafter. Maximum parking time limits apply via this method, normally of two or four hours. Full information on the [Cashless on-site parking info sheet](https://portal.eddington-cambridge.co.uk/_downloads/Eddington-Parking-Information_202309.pdf).

Residents and their visitors parking in these public spaces can use a separate system to register for a 24 hour period, and for a reduced fee (flat £2.80 at the time of writing). From January 2025 [RingGo](https://ringgo.co.uk/download) provides this service through its app - location code 829644. A limit of 100 days per year is applied per household to prevent a small number of residents from monopolising the limited spaces.

Where on-street signs refer to a "permit" they mean either of the above two methods of registration. There are no monthly or annual permits available for on-street parking.

90 minutes of free parking without registration is available for users of Sainsbury's and Argos in their underground car park. 18 hours of free parking without registration is available at Madingley Park & Ride.

</details>

[A Local Travel Survey](#travel-survey){:name='travel-survey'}
is carried out by the University every year. It surveys residents, workers, shoppers and families with kids at the local school about their use of different modes of transport. This helps to account for the growing and changing transport profile of the area.
Read the [2023 summary report](/reports/2023 stakeholders travel survey update.pdf){:target="_blank"}

[Through-Traffic](#traffic){:name='traffic'}
remains a concern for residents, with ongoing issues around speeding, crossings and road safety. With the [closure of Storey's Way](https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/7610580) to through traffic, Eddington Avenue/Turing Way comprise the only connection between Huntingdon Road and Madingley Road arterial routes between the [historic centre](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/52.2241566,0.0905129/52.2134716,0.0831837/@52.2174037,0.0873664,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d0.1114754!2d52.2115934!3s0x47d870b888942875:0xf18d62d3e0a0f585!1m0!3e0?entry=ttu){:target="_blank"} and [Madingley village](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/52.2241566,0.0905129/52.2134716,0.0831837/@52.2236613,0.0550861,13.89z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d0.0487948!2d52.2317013!3s0x47d877aa7ea3da5f:0xd04d88bf99fc17b1!1m0!3e0?entry=ttu){:target="_blank"}. Bollard control at the south end of Eddington Avenue protects the central block from much of this traffic, but has been frequently out of service due to repeated vehicle collisions. A replacement ANPR system is to be commissioned by the end of 2024.


## Water, waste, heating, internet, mobile etc.

[Water](#water){:name='water'}
is provided by [Cambridge Water](https://www.cambridge-water.co.uk/). Eddington is built on a [perched water table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_table#Perched_water_tables){:target="_blank"} with the increased flooding risk being offset by swales and other surface water collection that drains to the [lake at Brook Leys](https://eddington-cambridge.co.uk/news-and-updates/brook-leys-parkland-opens) in the south. The facility to recycle grey water from this lake back to residences was planned but is not yet active, apparently pending a legislation change.


[Rubbish & Recycling](#waste){:name='waste'}
is collected by South Cambs District council from our communal bins. Some green waste recycling is available [near central blocks](#green-bin-map), but not site-wide. Bulky waste which does not fit into the communal bins should be taken to the [Milton Waste Recycling Centre](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/directory/listings/milton-recycling-centre){:target="_blank"} or a [collection arranged with the council](https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/arrange-a-bulky-waste-collection). Fly-tipping around the bins should be reported to [Portal](#portal), who maintain a page of detailed information about waste management [here](https://portal.eddington-cambridge.co.uk/category/?cat_ID=1&subcat_ID=4&page_ID=65
) (requires a resident login).

<details markdown="1">
<summary>See map of green bin locations and details of free charity collection for household items</summary>

[Anglo Doorstep Collections](#anglo-doorstep-collections){:name='anglo-doorstep-collections'}
operate a free collection service for charity donations. Clothing and household items in good condition can be donated by [booking a collection](https://anglodoorstepcollections.co.uk/make-a-booking/?advert_id=cambridge_who#make_booking).

[Green bin locations](#green-bin-map){:#green-bin-map} are marked below with an "X".
![green bin locations](/images/maps/green-bins-2024.png)

</details>

[A Heat Network](#heat-network){:name='heat-network'}
provides hot water to most properties in Eddington for both space heating and water heating. The distributing network itself is a closed system of pipes connecting an HIU in each building to the Energy Centre on Burkitt Lane. It is managed by [Core](#core) with maintenance and billing provided by [Vital Energi](#vital).
The system is powered by commercial gas boilers after the original plan to run a [combined heat and power](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/combined-heat-and-power) plant proved infeasible. A more sustainable approach is desired by the University but has not yet been identified.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>See details of network design, resident responsibilities and heat pricing</summary>

The distribution network is a series of insulated, underground pipes which carry water at around 90°C. The circuit is closed: heat exchangers in each property's HIU raise the temperature of either their incoming fresh water or separately sealed underfloor circuits as needed. All water pumped out of the Energy Centre ultimately returns there - it does not come out of residents' taps nor does it flow through their underfloor heating circuits.

Core's equipment stops at the heat network pipes that enter each building. Homeowners are responsible for their HIU, which they own. The standing charge includes a two-yearly service from Core (for which access must be allowed). Underfloor heating and other domestic plumbing is also beyond the scope of Core's responsibilities.

Usage is charged for based on the difference in temperature between incoming and outgoing network water. As of early 2024, heat network billing is not covered by energy price caps though this effect is offset by the commercial gas purchasing policy of the University, which acts to hold input costs relatively stable.

</details>

[Internet Connectivity](#internet){:name='internet'}
is available from [many providers](https://www.openreach.com/fibre-broadband/fttp-providers) on the OpenReach fibre network. Many properties also have fibre connections to [Virgin Media](https://www.virginmedia.com/broadband). [Eduroam](https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/service/wifi/connect-to-eduroam) is available in some central areas but not within every building.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>See advice for short-term contracts and renewal</summary>

Residents on 12-month tenancies have reported difficulty finding ISPs offering contracts of less than 18 months. EU law requires [consumers be offered the option](https://web.archive.org/web/20110704193402/http://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/2011/05/uk-consumers-benefit-from-european-telecoms-law-changes/) of contract lasting no longer than 12 months, although some providers make these hard to find. Renewal of internet contracts is governed by [Ofcom's General Conditions](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/112282/guidance-under-general-conditions-c1-contract-requirements.pdf#page=5) which means ISPs have to get the customer's consent before renewing a fixed commitment period.

</details>

[Mobile Phone](#mobile){:name='mobile'}
signal in Eddington is strong in central areas but is more limited in the north and in the shadow of larger buildings. The insulating materials used in most buildings here block mobile networks - as a result many residents have to enable [WiFi Calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_calling) on their handset or change provider to [one which supports it](https://www.4g.co.uk/news/ee-o2-three-and-vodafone-which-networks-offer-wi-fi-calling/) in order to make and receive calls indoors.

## School, nursery and families

[University of Cambridge Primary School](https://www.universityprimaryschool.org.uk/){:name='primary-school'}
is a [new state school](https://www.universityprimaryschool.org.uk/) built to support the population growth in North West Cambridge. In 2024 it will have a school roll of 656 children across a single preschool class (for children turning 4 during that academic year) and three primary classes for reception through Year 6 (ages ~5 to ~11).

[Bright Horizons Day Nursery](https://www.brighthorizons.co.uk/our-nurseries/eddington-nursery){:name='nursery'} is a day nursery for children from 3 months to 5 years. 80% of places are reserved for the children of students and staff of the University, and subject to their own [application process](https://www.childcare.admin.cam.ac.uk/application-process).

[A State Secondary School](https://www.meridiantrust.co.uk/cmat-academies/darwin-green-academy/){:name='secondary-school'} with catchment area including Eddington and Darwin Green is intended to be built as part of DG2&3 (the north part of the Darwin Green project). The 600 to 900 place school for pupils aged 11 to 16  will be operated by the [Meridian multi-academy trust](https://www.meridiantrust.co.uk/). The master plan which includes the school was approved in 2024 however the estimated opening date is 2028. In the interim older kids are served by the distant [Impington Village College](https://ivc.tela.org.uk/) and [Chesterton Community College](https://ccc.tela.org.uk/) though the local school is officially a feeder for neither.

[Teddington Playgroup](https://eddington-cambridge.co.uk/whats-on/teddington){:name='teddington'} meets every Tuesday at 10am at Storey's Field Centre. There are toys and activities for babies, toddlers and pre-school kids - mostly unstructured play with some group singing at the end. Local health visitors regularly attend to offer advice and baby-weighing services, normally on the first Tuesday of the month.

## Health, fitness and wellbeing

[Our Local Doctor's Surgery](#doctor){:name='doctor'}
is [Huntingdon Road Surgery](https://huntingdonroadsurgery.co.uk/) until such time as the [health centre](#health-centre) is occupied. It also has a [satellite surgery](https://www.nhs.uk/services/gp-surgery/girton-branch-surgery/D81002001) in Girton.

[No Pharmacy](#pharmacy){:name='pharmacy'}
exists in Eddington, nor can residents use the [dispensary in Girton](https://www.huntingdonroadsurgery.co.uk/girton-dispensary) run by Huntingdon Road Surgery. The nearest pharmacy is on [Histon Road](https://rowlandspharmacy.co.uk/). Plans for a local pharmacy seem contingent on there being a doctor's surgery here first, at which point Sainsbury's have indicated they may add one in-store.

[The Health Centre](#heath-centre){:name='health-centre'}
is at the south end of Eddington Avenue ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/@52.2170912,0.0882417,3a,42.9y,275.96h,96.26t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s3aYXVcbz4yZbBBHY_OlrTQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu)), near Sainsbury's car park entrance. The unit is empty and its interior unfinished. Negotiations with the NHS to find an occupant have been very slow. In early 2024 Portal said a proposal was being considered for a multi-use health facility - which means not exclusively a doctor's office but with an NHS GP provision among other health services. The proposal targeted an opening in mid 2025, we are told.

[Children's Playgrounds](){:name='playgrounds'}

## Shared spaces and estate management

[Estate Service Charge](https://portal.eddington-cambridge.co.uk/estate-service-charge/){:name='estate-service-charge'}
is a fee collected by Portal to fund the maintenance of shared spaces and facilities in Eddington. These include footpaths, cycleways, lighting, hard and soft landscaping, signage, play parks, the Square and non-Council-adopted roads (which is all roads at the time of writing in spring 2025). Areas not maintained under the estate service charge include the playing fields, pavilions, Storey's Field Centre, Brook Leys (funded by the University) and the heat network (funded through Core standing charge).

All occupants of Eddington contribute to this fund proportionately by the internal floor area of their property. This includes private home owners; renters; key workers renting from Lodge; commercial entities (e.g. hotels and shops); and Girton college for Swirles Court. The budget is produced annually by Portal with the new year starting on the 1st of August.

[Safety and Security](#safety){:name='safety'}
remains a key concern for our residents. While Cambridge is a relatively low-crime city, bike thefts and antisocial behaviour are common. In Eddington it is likely because this is a quiet area with lots of public space and a late-opening, licensed supermarket. Residents are urged to [report all incidents](https://www.cambs.police.uk/report) and suspicious behaviour to the police - and by calling 999 if urgent e.g. a crime in progress. If you are unsure whether or not an event should be reported, use the [Cambs Police live chat](https://www.cambs.police.uk/police-forces/cambridgeshire-constabulary/areas/services/web-chat/) for advice. As a new borough of the city, sustained reporting of undesirable activity is needed to guide the allocation of police resources.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>See how Portal, Encore and the University fit into local safety planning</summary>

[Portal](#portal) is responsible for the physical security of some areas of site, including commercial units, University buildings and communal bike sheds. [Encore](#encore) is similarly in charge of shared spaces in leasehold properties like garages and stairwells. However, residents are encouraged to consider these areas public when making security decisions as it is difficult to prevent criminals from gaining access to such shared spaces.

The University has its own [security service](https://www.security.admin.cam.ac.uk/) as well as CCTV monitoring in the central area of Eddington, which they plan to extend to cover entrance/exit routes. They have a published [security policy](https://eddington-cambridge.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Security-Policy-Final.pdf) and [antisocial behaviour policy](https://eddington-cambridge.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Anti-Social-Behaviour-Policy-Final.pdf) for the area.

</details>

## Local shops, amenities and facilities

[Eddington Square](#square){:name='square'}
is a public plaza surrounded by commercial units and key worker accommodation in the center of Eddington. The shopfronts are leased by the University and are targeting a mix of offerings from local or small chains, with Sainsbury's/Argos being the early exception. Residents have historically bemoaned the number of empty units, though as of early 2025 the majority are occupied and all but two are in the process of being fitted out.

[Hyatt Commercial Units](#hyatt-units){:name='hyatt-units'}
are the other commercial spaces in Eddington. Like the central gardens, these facilities are open to the public and include a hairdresser (Douce), coffee shop (Brew), restaurant (The Architect) and cocktail bar (Dutch).

[Storey's Field Centre](https://www.storeysfieldcentre.org.uk/){:name='sfc'}
is a community centre with meeting rooms, studio space and large performance space. This [architectural award-winning](https://www.architecture.com/awards-and-competitions-landing-page/awards/riba-regional-awards/riba-east-award-winners/2018/storeys-field-community-centre-and-nursery) building hosts regular community events, classes, meetings and shows, and is available for private hire. It was originally a joint venture between Cambridge University and Cambridge City Council but changed to being solely managed by the University in late 2024.

[No Public Library](#library){:name='library'}
currently exists in Eddington, nor are we aware of plans to build one. The [Mobile Library](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/residents/libraries-leisure-culture/libraries/visit-a-library/mobile-libraries/find-a-mobile-library-stop) stops outside Storey's Field Centre on the first Friday of the month from 9:30am to 10:40am. A community library building exists in Darwin Green near the Community Centre but does not currently contain any books.

[The local Post Office](https://www.postofficeviews.co.uk/national-consultation-team/west-cambridge-university-cb3-0us-1-011113/){:name='post-office'}
is in West Hub on the West Cambridge site, just south of Eddington.

[Brook Leys](#brook-leys){:name='brook-leys'}
comprises eleven hectares of public parkland in the south east of Eddington. It contains a lake, walking paths, nature areas, public art and BBQ/picnic spots. The lake functions as a reservoir for surface water drainage from the site, though it is not yet used for its ultimate purpose of supplying grey water back to homes.
