This policy aims to ensure the safety of those undertaking activities on behalf of the Eddington
Residents Association (ERA) and the children, young people and adults we come into contact with.
The ERA is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, young people and
adults. We take our responsibilities seriously and expect all workers and volunteers to share this
commitment.

Safeguarding is about protecting children and adults who might be at risk from abuse and neglect
which can be physical, emotional, sexual or financial. We also want to keep our volunteers safe from
allegation and deter anyone looking to use this as an opportunity to abuse others.
ERA will:

1. Promote good practice that encourages a safe environment, protects all parties and avoids
mistaken allegations of abuse
2. Have a designated Safeguarding Lead who:
a. Will oversee the association’s safeguarding responsibilities
b. Be the point of contact for safeguarding concerns (receive and action)
c. Ensure cover for this role in their absence
d. Ensure any incidents of poor practice, allegations and suspicions are reported, taken
seriously and responded to swiftly and appropriately
3. Recruit volunteers as safely as possible at this time by:
a. Collecting names, addresses and contact information
b. Checking identities
c. Collecting copies of DBS checks if available and recording the reference number and
date of check
d. Asking and recording if the applicant has been barred from working with children and
adults
e. Rejecting applicants whose identities cannot be verified or who are barred
4. Provide all volunteers with safeguarding awareness information on:
a. What safeguarding means
b. Who the Safeguarding Lead is
c. What their responsibilities are and are not
d. What to do if they have a concern
e. How to keep themselves safe

We will implement good practice to record that the information has been given and
training has been undertaken wherever possible. Additional training materials are
available at http://www.safeguardingcambspeterborough.org.uk

5. Support volunteers in their work by:
a. Establishing protocols and good working practice and boundaries for the tasks being
undertaken
b. Working in pairs where necessary
c. Providing a contact for volunteers for emotional support
6. Share and store confidential and sensitive data appropriately:
a. Making every effort to ensure that confidentiality is maintained for all concerned
b. Undertaking its obligations to report disclosures and concerns and reserve the right
to report child and adult safeguarding issues
c. Ensuring information is accurate, relevant and stored securely with limited access to
only those who need it

Volunteers are expected to:

1. Be aware of this policy
2. Undertake training and note the information provided
3. Not undertake any activities outside of those agreed with the Association as the role of
volunteer
4. Know who the association’s Safeguarding Lead is and how to contact them
5. Report any concerns, however small, including but not limited to any concerns of danger to
anyone, inappropriate behaviour or bad practice to the Safeguarding Lead or to another
senior person if it is about the Safeguarding Lead
6. Ask for any support needed
