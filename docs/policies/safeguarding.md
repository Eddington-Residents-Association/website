title: Safeguaring Policy
date: 2022-02-06

This policy aims to ensure the safety of those undertaking activities on behalf of the Eddington Residentsâ€™ Association (ERA) and the children, young people and adults we come into contact with. The ERA is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, young people and adults. We take our responsibilities seriously and expect all those in the Association to share this commitment.

Safeguarding is about protecting children and adults who might be at risk from abuse and neglect which can be physical, emotional, sexual or financial. We also want to keep colleagues safe from allegation and deter anyone looking to use this as an opportunity to abuse others.

The ERA will require that all children and vulnerable adults attending events it sponsors are accompanied at all times by parents and carers who will be responsible for their safety. Parents and carers will specifically not be allowed to leave their children and vulnerable adults unattended during activities, even for a short time. The ERA has no power to oversee arrangements parents may make to leave their children in the care of others (e.g. other parents) and cannot take any responsibility for these arrangements.

Where the ERA supports community activities organised by others (e.g. by providing funding) it will strongly recommend that the organisers adopt the same policy. The ERA is not in a position to demand Disclosure and Barring Service checks from those who participate in its activities, nor to ban from its activities those who do not wish to apply for such checks.

The ERA will however promote good practice that encourages a safe environment and protects all parties to the extent it is able to do so. Where concerns are drawn to the attention of the ERA or its Committee it will make every effort to ensure their investigation in a timely manner by the appropriate agencies, and respect confidentiality when it does so. Participants in ERA events will be encouraged to bring any concerns to the attention of the Association as soon as possible, and will be assured that they will be investigated. Records of such concerns and their subsequent investigation will be held securely and only shared with statutory agencies.

This policy was agreed upon by the Association's Committee.
