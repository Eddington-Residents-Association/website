## Introduction

The Eddington Residents Association (ERA) was set up in September 2019 to support and represent
people living and working in Eddington, Cambridge. This privacy policy describes what personal data we collect, how we use it, how to obtain your personal data from us and for how long we will retain your data.

## What information do we hold about you?

If you subscribe to our newsletter, register on our website or book any of our events, we will hold the information that you provide to us. This information may include
- Name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Address

## How will we use the information about you?

If you subscribe to our newsletter, register on our website or book any of our events, your information will be seen on a “need to know” basis only by the ERA committee and/or event organisers. We will not disclose any information about you to any other organisation or individual unless required to do so by law.

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the lawful bases we rely on for processing your
information are:

- Your consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time. You can do this by contacting us (contact details below)
- We have a legitimate interest.

## Communicating with you

If you are an Eddington resident, we may want to send you newsletters and other information
concerning the activities of ERA, and we will use the information you provide to do this. You have a
right at any time to stop us from contacting you for communication purposes other than
communicating with you personally and directly. All our communication emails will include an
unsubscribe option.

## Access to your information and correction

Regardless of whether you are a volunteer during an ERA event or an Eddington resident, you have
the right to request a copy of the information that we hold about you. We want to make sure that
your personal information is accurate and up to date. You may contact us to correct or remove
information you think is inaccurate.

## Retention of data
We will securely retain the information we hold about you for the duration of ERA’s, after which it will be securely deleted. Note that, although we will delete the data, the deletion may take some time to be fully effective, e.g. for data stored on our database providers’ systems, who will only commit to deleting backups within a year. Our data retention policies are compliant with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations 2018 (GDPR).
