## We are your neighbours
The Eddington Residents' Association (ERA) is a volunteer run neighbourhood organisation made up of local residents, who strive to build a vibrant, welcoming and connected community. ERA is run by a committee set up in September 2019, when volunteers of the local Eddington Open Door, Eddington Eats and the Eddington Film Club initiatives joined together under one umbrella.
