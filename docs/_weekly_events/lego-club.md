Running weekly during school term time, this is community building at its most literal: a giant tub of Lego and one hour to make your model! Just turn up and play. Suitable for ages 4 to 99; children must be accompanied by a grown up.

This event is kindly run by the Storey's Field staff and children must be accompanied by a responsible adult. Adults are expected to help with the tidying at the end please!
