We are a community organised fibre arts circle. Everyone is welcomed: knitters, crocheters, sewists or whatever your favourite portable fibre arts is. Or maybe you are looking into picking up a fun and rewarding hobby? Either way, this is great opportunity to meet the neighbours over a drink in a relaxed atmosphere.
